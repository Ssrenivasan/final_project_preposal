# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- 2d sprite game. Must defeat the alien as it mutants every single round. Max of 5 rounds. Character has 5 hearts.
    - Alien has special attacks that are discovered as rounds pass. The map (city) also modifies a little every time.
    - Maybe a leaderboard to track speed.
    - sprites for alien and character.
- Twitter bot to track NFT sales from Opensea and it tweets out every sale with some info like price, art, etc.
    - Using opensea api and twitter developer api
    - How to embed the tweet to make it readable.
    - Hosting the app on Heroku
- mobile 2d racing game (have no idea how to and where to start)
    - 2d map
    - against robot (static every race)
    - powerups?
    - leaderboard to see who has the fastest lap
